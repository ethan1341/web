# Mastering CSS Grid Layout

CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system designed for the web. It lets you organize content into rows and columns and has many features that make building complex layouts straightforward.

## Why Use CSS Grid?

CSS Grid offers several advantages over older layout methods:

- **Two-dimensional control** - arrange items in rows AND columns simultaneously
- **No need for frameworks** - native browser support means no extra dependencies
- **Simplified HTML** - less wrapper divs and cleaner markup
- **Responsive design** - built-in tools for responsive layouts without media queries

## Basic Grid Concepts

Creating a grid container is as simple as:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-gap: 20px;
}
```

This creates a three-column grid with equal width columns and 20px gaps.

## Powerful Features

### Grid Template Areas

One of the most intuitive features is named grid areas:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header header"
    "sidebar content content"
    "footer footer footer";
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 3fr 1fr;
  grid-gap: 10px;
}

.header { grid-area: header; }
.sidebar { grid-area: sidebar; }
.content { grid-area: content; }
.footer { grid-area: footer; }
```

This creates a visual representation of your layout right in the CSS!

### Auto-placement

CSS Grid can automatically place items in a grid:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));
  grid-gap: 20px;
}
```

This creates as many 200px columns as will fit in the container, making it perfect for responsive galleries or card layouts.

## Browser Support

CSS Grid is supported in all modern browsers, making it a reliable choice for production websites.

By mastering CSS Grid, you'll be equipped to create advanced layouts that were once only possible with significant hacks or JavaScript assistance, all with clean, semantic HTML and pure CSS.
