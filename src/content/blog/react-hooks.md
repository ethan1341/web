# Understanding React Hooks

React Hooks have revolutionized how we write React components since their introduction in React 16.8. They allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class component.

## Why Hooks?

Before Hooks, React developers faced several challenges:

- **Reusing stateful logic** was difficult between components
- **Complex components** became hard to understand
- **Classes** confused both people and machines

Hooks solve these problems by letting you:
- Extract stateful logic from a component for easy reuse
- Split complex components into smaller functions
- Use React features without classes

## Most Common Hooks

### useState

The most basic Hook for managing state in functional components:

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### useEffect

This Hook lets you perform side effects in function components:

```jsx
function ProfilePage({ userId }) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchUser(userId).then(data => setUser(data));
    
    return () => {
      // Cleanup code
    };
  }, [userId]); // Only re-run if userId changes
  
  return user ? <Profile user={user} /> : <Loading />;
}
```

## Custom Hooks

One of the most powerful features of Hooks is the ability to create your own custom Hooks:

```jsx
function useWindowWidth() {
  const [width, setWidth] = useState(window.innerWidth);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => setWidth(window.innerWidth);
    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
  }, []);
  
  return width;
}

// Usage
function MyComponent() {
  const width = useWindowWidth();
  return <div>Window width: {width}</div>;
}
```

Hooks have transformed React development by making code more reusable, easier to understand, and less verbose. They're now the recommended way to write React components.
